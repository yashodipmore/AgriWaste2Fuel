# 🌾 AgriWaste2Fuel – Smart Farm Waste Tracker & Bio-Fertilizer Planner

**Annam.Ai Hackathon-Based Internship Project – Group 3A**  
**Date:** 6th September 2025

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AgriWaste2Fuel** is an AI-powered platform that helps farmers detect, classify, and manage agricultural waste in an eco-friendly way. It guides them on whether to compost or convert the waste into biogas and estimates the environmental benefits like GHG emission savings and carbon credit potential.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is currently an idea-stage project under active brainstorming and planning. The implementation will follow in the coming weeks.

---

## 🌱 Problem Statement

> **Domain:** Agriculture & Environment  
> **Challenge:** Efficient farm waste management with environmental benefit tracking.

We aim to build a **smart waste converter** that:
- Detects & classifies farm waste.
- Recommends biogas or compost processing.
- Estimates GHG emissions saved.
- Converts those savings into potential carbon credits.

## 📅 Week 1 Summary – Internship Kickoff

### ✅ Activities Completed
- Brainstormed real-world farmer problems in Maharashtra.
- Finalized the idea: biogas + compost + GHG + credit.
- Designed architecture for decision engine.
- Created decision-tree model for biogas vs compost.
- Identified data sources (ICAR, MNRE, TERI).
- Explored initial models for yield prediction.
- Visualized project flow and interfaces.

### 🧠 Challenges Faced
- Lack of open datasets for biogas/compost yield.
- Balancing core vs extra features.
- Aligning the team focus during ideation.

### 🙌 Mentor Guidance
- Encouraged us to center the project around **real-world utility**.
- Suggested using **regression models** for estimating output.
- Recommended **farmer-first design** over complex ML.

## 🧩 System Modules

### 1. **Farm Waste Detection & Classification**
- Image-based detection (YOLOv8)
- Manual keyword input (NLP/regex)
- Waste quantity estimation

### 2. **Biogas or Compost Recommendation**
- Decision tree logic based on type & quantity
- Output: suggested method, steps, tools, expected result

### 3. **GHG Savings Prediction**
- Use weight and standard emission factors
- Calculate savings using:  
  `GHG Saved = weight × (EF_burning − EF_conversion)`

### 4. **Carbon Credit Estimation**
- 1 ton CO₂e saved = 1 credit
- Multiply by market rate
- Optional: generate digital certificate
